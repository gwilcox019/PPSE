To compile : use Makefile
To simulate : ./simulator -m [min_SNR float] -M [max_SNR float] -s [step_val float] -e [f_max uint] -K [info_bits uint] -N [codeword_size uint] -c ["monitor-neon" string] -D ["rep-hard"|"rep-hard8"|"rep-soft"|"rep-soft8"|"rep-hard8-neon"|"rep-soft8-neon" string] -f [sim_name string] -o ["mod-all-ones"|"mod-neon" string] --src-all-zeros --demod-neon --qf [f uint] --qs [s uint] -t [threads] -p [bit-packing]

Results for all five sims (from TP3) for all five of our optimizations are in `FINAL SIMS`; K=32 are found directly under each optimization, whereas K=128 are in the `big_k` folder. Graphs of block throughput (where applicable), overall throughput, and error rates in terms of SNR are provided for each simulation comparing each optimization with the non-optimized control configuration. These can be found under `FINAL GRAPHS`. A report of the development and analysis of the results of each optimization are in the attached PDF along with select graphs to aid in the analysis.
